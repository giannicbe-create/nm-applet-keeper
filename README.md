# nm-applet-keeper

### What is this?

This is a small `.deb` package for **Linux Mint MATE** (and similar desktops) that keeps the **network icon** in the panel (the one you click to connect to Wi-Fi or check the cable connection).  

Sometimes this icon (`nm-applet`) disappears… and that’s annoying.  
This package makes sure it always comes back automatically.
